                                     <p>Finally, you can always try your luck with online auctions. Sites like eBay often have tablets up for auction, and you may be able to snag one at a deeply discounted price.</p>

                                     <p> Whatever route you decide to take, there's a good chance you can get your hands on a free tablet in 2022 if you're willing to put in a little effort.
