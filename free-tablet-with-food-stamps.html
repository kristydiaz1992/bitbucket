<h2>What are the SNAP Eligibility Criteria?</h2>
<p>To be eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), otherwise known as food stamps, you must be a U.S. citizen or a legal permanent resident. You must also meet certain income and asset criteria.</p>
<p><strong>Income:</strong></p>
<p>Your household&rsquo;s gross income must be at or below 130% of the federal poverty level. This means that if your household consists of just one person, your gross income must be $1,287 or less per month. For a family of four, the gross income limit is $2,708.</p>
<p>Note that these income limits are higher in Alaska and Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>Assets:</strong></p>
<p>Your household&rsquo;s total assets must be below $2,250, or $3,250 if at least one member of your household is 60 years old or disabled. Assets include savings and checking accounts, stocks and bonds, and vehicles (excluding your primary vehicle).</p>
<p>To learn more about the SNAP eligibility criteria, or to apply for benefits, visit the website of the U.S. Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Food and Nutrition Service.</p>
<h2>What Basic Documents are Required to Get the Food Stamps Benefit?</h2>
<p>There are a few basic documents required in order to get the food stamps benefit. The first is a photo ID, which can be a driver's license, state ID, or passport. The second is proof of citizenship or legal residency, which can be a birth certificate, naturalization papers, or a green card.</p>
<p>The third is proof of income, which can be a pay stub, tax return, or Social Security benefits statement. The fourth is proof of assets, which can be a bank statement or asset verification form.</p>
<p>Almost all states offer some type of food assistance program to help low-income residents afford groceries. However, only a handful of states currently offer free tablets or smartphones to residents who receive food stamps. The following states/territories currently have programs in place to provide free tablets or smartphones to food stamp recipients:</p>
<p>- Arkansas<br />- Connecticut<br />- Delaware<br />- District of Columbia<br />- Hawaii<br />- Illinois<br />- Indiana<br />- Iowa<br />- Kentucky<br />- Louisiana<br />- Maine<br />- Maryland<br />- Massachusetts<br />- Michigan<br />- Minnesota<br />- Missouri<br />- Montana<br />- Nevada<br />- New Hampshire<br />- New Jersey<br />- New Mexico<br />- New York<br />- North Dakota<br />- Ohio<br />- Oklahoma<br />- Oregon<br />- Pennsylvania<br />- Rhode Island<br />- South Dakota<br />- Vermont<br />- Virginia <br />- West Virginia<br />- Wisconsin</p>
<p>The specifics of each program vary, but generally, recipients are eligible for a free tablet or smartphone if they are enrolled in the food stamp program and do not already have a device. Some states limit the number of devices per household, while others allow each individual food stamp recipient to receive a device.</p>
<p>If you live in one of the states listed above and are interested in receiving a free tablet or smartphone through your food stamp benefits, contact your local food stamp office for more information.</p>
