<h3>Why Does T-Mobile Participate With EBB Program?</h3>

<p>  T-Mobile participates in the EBB program to provide discounts for employees of companies that have a business agreement with T-Mobile. The EBB program is a way for T-Mobile to show its appreciation to these companies and to support their employees.</p>

    <p>  The EBB program provides a discount of up to 15% on monthly service plans, as well as a waived activation fee and other perks. This can save employees of participating companies a significant amount of money on their monthly phone bill.</p>

        <p>  In addition to the financial benefits, the EBB program also helps to foster a sense of community and loyalty among T-Mobile customers. By providing these discounts, T-Mobile is able to show its appreciation for the business of these companies and their employees. This can help to create a long-term relationship between T-Mobile and these customers.</p>



<h3> What Documentation Is Required For T-Mobile EBB Tablet? </h3>

<p>T-Mobile's EBB Tablet comes with a few different documentation requirements, depending on what you plan to use the tablet for. If you're just using the tablet for personal use, then you won't need much documentation. However, if you're planning on using the tablet for business purposes, then you'll need to provide some additional documentation.</p>

    <p>For personal use, the only documentation you'll need is a valid ID and a credit or debit card. You'll also need to sign up for a T-Mobile account, which you can do online or in person at a T-Mobile store.</p>

        <p>If you're using the tablet for business purposes, you'll need to provide a few additional pieces of documentation. First, you'll need to provide a business license or permit. You'll also need to provide proof of business insurance. Finally, you'll need to provide a W-9 form.</p>
